# PoE-Style Game Randomiser

**Node.js • Express • PostgreSQL**

*Fan-made project. Not affiliated with or endorsed by Grinding Gear Games or Path of Exile 2.*

---

## Overview

This is a small full-stack web application that dynamically generates results based on user selections.

Users select options from dropdown menus, and the backend returns randomly selected data from a PostgreSQL database. All filtering and randomisation logic is handled server-side using **Node.js** and **Express**.

The project demonstrates practical backend logic, database querying, and frontend–backend integration in a clean, well-scoped application.

## Key Functionality

- Dropdown-driven user input  
- Express routes responding to frontend requests  
- PostgreSQL queries filtered by user selections  
- Server-side random result generation  
- Dynamic content returned without page reloads  

---

## Why This Project Matters

This project uses the same patterns found in many real-world features, such as:

- Product or option selectors  
- Random generators  
- Quiz or learning tools  
- Configuration and recommendation logic  

The core logic can be easily adapted to non-game applications.
